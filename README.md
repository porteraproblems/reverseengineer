## Installation
This generator requires the user to install dependencies using the command "npm i" in their terminal. After installation to run the application, run "npm start" from your server.
## Guide
As a developer, 

I WANT users to begin by launching the application by going to the link provided in the documentation. After the application launches, the user will have the chance to sign up or login if they have already been to the site. Signing up is easy, the user provides a valid email and then a password that is a minimum of 8 characters.  After signing up, the user can then use the email and password they just inputted into the form to log in. Once the user is signed in, they will be greeted with a personalized welcome message that includes the email the user provided. When the user is finished, the will need to logout

I want this SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for future projects.
